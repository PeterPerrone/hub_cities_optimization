# Hub-and-Spoke Optimization Project
by Brendan Woodward and Pietro Perrone

This repository holds all code related to creating the LP model in Gurobi and generating relevant plots.

The LP model logic is stored in the ```model.py``` file, with helpers in ```functions.py``` and plotting capabilities in ```plots.py```.

The scripts which run these models for different configurations are in files beginning with "main".
